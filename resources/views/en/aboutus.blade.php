                                The National Kiswahili Council, translated into Kiswahili as Baraza la Kiswahili la Taifa, (BAKITA) is a Public Organization which operates under the Ministry responsible for Culture. The Council was established by an Act of Parliament No. 27 of 1967 and its amendments of 1983 and 2016 . The Act mandates the Council with authority to manage and coordinate all activities related with the promotion of Kiswahili in the United Republic of Tanzania and beyond. Establishment of the Council was in line with recommendations made by the Committee of language practitioners formed by the Minister of Education in December 1961, to develop proposals for the development of Kiswahili as a national language. The Council started its operations with four members of staff who were housed in the offices of the Ministry of Education. Among the first tasks of the Council was to develop Kiswahili technical vocabularies for different domains of knowledge. In 1972; the Council moved to the Coronation Building of the National House Corporation at Samora and Azikiwe Avenues in Dar es Salaam, and in 2012 the Council moved to Plot Number 45 B, Kijitonyama in Dar es Salaam.
